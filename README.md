Ticket to Tech
Group members: Carrie Houston, Makenzie Kadjeski, & Jeny Thomas

Purpose: This project compares the amount of time it takes for several different path planning algorithms- Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A* Search, and Bidirectional Search- to find the shortest path between two given vertices. This program receives user input as the start and end point, prints the path taken, and the time it took to compute that path. Our data is based off of the buildings at Tennessee Tech and their relative locations to each other.

Code: The code is written in C++ and python. A kaggle (jupyter) notebook was created as well.

Presentation: The presentation sums up the project.

Report: The report is a detailed description of our path planning project.

Results: The results include figures and tables from our experiment. More details and descriptions on these graphs and tables are found in the report.
